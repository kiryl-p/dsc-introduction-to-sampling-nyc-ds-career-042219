    "Rarely, if ever, are we able to completely survey a population of interest. Similarly, we will often deal with missing data. Whatever it may be, whether estimating asthma rates, fish populations, daily temperatures, material volumes, risk, manufacturing defects or any other measurement of unknown or large scale quantities, we are unlikely to have complete information of the system in question. As a result, we do our best by taking samples and using these to estimate the corresponding measurements for the complete population, from which we took the sample. These estimates of population parameters are known as **point estimates**. Interestingly, point estimates of specific parameters of a population have predictable behaviors, in that the point estimates themselves will form specific probability distributions. For example, we may want to know information about the age of a population. One parameter we might want to estimate is the mean age of the population. Once we take a sample, we can take the mean age of that sample and that would become the point estimate for the mean age of the entire population. If we continue to take more samples from the population, the mean age of each of these samples will begin to form a normal distribution! This intriguing fact lets us apply some logic and calculate confidence intervals surrounding our point estimates so that we not only have a best guess for the parameter, but also can have a range to describe various levels of certainty on our estimates. Ideally, these ranges will be small, indicating that we have a high degree of confidence that the parameter is very close to our estimate.\n",
